            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am <em>Jingwei Gao</em>. I come from China, now I live in Ottawa. I am 27 years old. I have a small family here in Canada with my wife and my 1-year-old daughter. I also have two yorkies, which one of them is 7 years old, another is 3 years old. My daughter and dogs have became best friends recently.</p>
            <p>I am currently in the 1<sup>st</sup> year in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> programin <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>. I choose this program because I like user interface design and photography. I love traveling and get in touch with new stuff, therfore, I am a divergent thinking person rather than concentrating on one thing so that I can have fresh idea when I meet problems. My favorite quotation is, <cite>“Learn as if you will live forever, live like you will die tomorrow.”</cite> — <em>Mahatma Gandhi</em></p>
